## GitHUb & Git
- Github is basically a code sharing and collaboration platform.
- Git is basically a version control system and version control means keeping track of the versions of your files. 
For example we created the html file for the first time we created it means we have first version of it and when we save it after creation thatâ€™s means we have created and save the first version of our file. But Suppose we have changed something in our file now if we save it the system have just the latest file which is the updated version so means its second version of file but what about the previous version and where is it now ?. So here Git serve us in quite efficient way who actually controls and save all the versions of our all files.
