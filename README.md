#  Git-Learning-and-Installation-

We will learn here the basics about git & github. After that we will learn how to install and use it.

## GitHUb & Git
- Github is basically a code sharing and collaboration platform.
- Git is basically a version control system and version control means keeping track of the versions of your files. For example (Keep in mind this example is to create and save a file in our system not on server for now.) we created the html file for the first time we created it means we have first version of it and when we save it after creation that’s means we have created and save the first version of our file. But Suppose we have changed something in our file now if we save it the system have just the latest file which is the updated version so means its second version of file but what about the previous version and where is it now ?. So here Git serve us in quite efficient way who actually controls and save all the versions of our all files.

## Why we use Git

We have some techniques or ways through which we can control versions but most of them have some draw backs and on the same time Git give us opportunity to control the version in quite efficient way that’s why we like to use that for example

## Drop box:

- Drop box periodically save the versions of the files and we can see the previous version by using history. But drop box save these versions for only 30 days. So it have some limitations. We can’t use it offline too. But yes drop box can do proper editor work.

##Google Docs:

- Google Docs is clearly not design to control versions of the code file. They are special purpose editors not design to highlight the editor work like (), syntax etc. Can’t use offline too.

In upper both the approaches to use as version control doesn’t helps us in quite efficient way .As a programmer we want a specific type of version control system where whenever we do some change in our code can do changes on control system too and when we need previous version it will allow us to get the previous version whether that previous version would be of last year. On the same time we need that control system who give us whole information regarding to changes and also give us feature through which we can compare the changes in versions. These all things which are the basic need of programming based version control system are not provided by the upper two examples somehow they lack in that. So here Git is been introduced who is such an efficient and well organized controlling system through which we as programmer can do any change whether we are online or offline is never been lost. 

## Git Installation's Commands and implementation

##Repository Creation

We have to create a repository for a new project on BitBucket .

- Go on  [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org).

- Select Repositories from top nevigation bar and from drop down select Create Repository.

- Give name and check Access Level if you want to make ur repository private (i select private because i want to make my repository private).

- Select Repository type as Git.

- Click Create repository.
